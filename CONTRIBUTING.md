cd <repository-name>
```

### Install Dependencies

```

Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5173` (or the port specified) to see the app running.

## Making Changes

### Create a New Branch

Before making any changes, create a new branch:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

### Make Your Changes

Make the desired changes to the codebase using your preferred code editor.

### Test Your Changes

Ensure that your changes do not break existing functionality:

```bash
# Run tests (if available)
npm test
# or
yarn test
```

### Build the Project (Optional)

To test the production build:

```bash
# Using npm
npm run build

# Using yarn
yarn build
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

### Commit Your Changes

Add and commit your changes with a descriptive message:

```

### Push to Your Fork

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

### Create a Pull Request

1. Navigate to your fork on GitHub.
2. Click the **Compare & pull request** button.
3. Ensure the base fork is the original repository and the base branch is `main` (or the appropriate branch).
4. Provide a clear and descriptive title for your pull request.
5. In the description, explain the changes you've made and any relevant context.
6. Submit the pull request.

## Code Review and Merging

- **Review Process**: Your pull request will be reviewed by maintainers. Please be responsive to any feedback and make necessary changes.
- **Merging**: Once approved, your pull request will be merged into the main codebase.
- **Delete Branch**: After merging, you can safely delete your branch:
